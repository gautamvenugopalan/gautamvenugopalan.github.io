										<h2>Gravitational waves and optomechanics</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916. While General Relativity (GR) predicts that they're ubiquitous, the effect these waves have on anything we observe is extremely minute, and therefore, making a <em>direct</em> measurement of them was an extremely challenging proposition. After decades of careful engineering by hundreds of scientists, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration succeeded in measuring gravitational waves emitted from a pair of black holes colliding more than a billion light years away from Earth. I was lucky enough to spend my graduate school career with the collaboration during this extremely exciting time. 
										
									</p>
									<p>
										There are <a href="https://www.ligo.org/multimedia.php">many excellent resources</a> explaining how the LIGO interferometers work and the astrophysical significance of the signals they measure. Below is a graphic that is bread-and-butter for scientists trying to improve the sensitivity of the LIGO detectors - a "noise budget". As the name suggests, it accounts for various sources of noise that limit the sensitivity of the interferometers - once we know what limits us, we can make an attempt to improve it. Over multiple observing runs, I was part of the team that lead to significant sensitivity improvements. Also overlaid are the signal contents of two [out of what now numbers $\mathcal{O}(100)$] particularly significant events, GW150914 (pair of black holes) and GW170817 (pair of neutron stars) - where the signal power is higher than the detector noise, we can make a measurement with good signal-to-noise ratio.

										While detecting astrophysical events have become an almost "routine" event as of the third observing run, several planned improvements are to be made to improve their sensitivity and duty cycle even further. The LIGO interferometers are some of the most complex instruments ever built, and boast cutting edge performance in mechanics, electronics, laser stability (intensity and frequency), and real-time control systems. Some projects I worked on are briefly described below.

										<h3>Quantum optomechanics</h3>
										<p>
											Light carries momentum, and when it interacts with matter (e.g. it reflects off a mirror), it transfers momentum to it. Optomechanics is the umbrella term used for the study of such phenomena. In the last two decades, the availability of stable laser sources have lead to several landmark results in optomechanics, which are graphically summarized below:

The mass and frequency scale of LIGO [j], the Caltech 40 m prototype interferometer, and <a href="research_optlev.html">optically levitated microspheres</a>, are highlighted.</figcaption>
											</figure>
										</p>
										<p>
											Quantum mechanics dictates that there is a fundamental uncertainty associated with the arrival of photons at a given location. This uncertainty sets a limit to how precisely a measurement can be made with light, known as <em>shot noise</em>. For the same reason, the momentum transfer between photons and any matter it interacts with also has a statistical noise associated with it, known as <em>radiation pressure noise</em>. The combination of these two effects set a measurement limit known as the <em>Standard Quantum Limit</em>. Saturating this limit for "macroscopic" measurement devices (such as the 40 kg LIGO mirrors) has been a long-standing experimental physics goal which has been recently realized. It is also possible to circumvent the limit using a technique known as <em>squeezing</em>, which the LIGO interferometers have been successfully employing to improve their sensitivity in the last few years. 
										</p>
										<p>
											In order to exploit squeezing, correlations have to be built up between photons. To date, the preferred technique of doing this is by using non-linear optical crystals. However, optomechanics offers a natural alternative. I worked towards realizing such a scheme at the 40 m prototype interferometer, a fully instrumented, 1/100 scale replica of the LIGO interferometers at Caltech.
